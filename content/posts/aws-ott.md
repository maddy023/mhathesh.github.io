title: "Building a Scalable OTT Platform Using AWS MediaConvert"
---

In this project, we developed a robust backend infrastructure for an OTT (Over-The-Top) streaming platform using AWS services such as S3, MediaConvert, and CloudFront CDN. Our goal was to provide a seamless, high-quality streaming experience for movies, adaptable to various internet speeds and screen resolutions.

### Workflow Overview

1.  **Content Upload and Storage**: We obtained movie files from our vendors and stored them in Amazon S3. S3 served as our primary storage solution, allowing scalable, secure, and durable storage for large media files.
    
2.  **Media Conversion**: To support adaptive streaming, we used AWS MediaConvert to transcode the video files into [HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) format](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert/latest/ug/using-hls-inputs.html). This format is optimized for dynamic streaming, enabling users to experience smooth playback with different resolutions and bandwidths, automatically adjusted based on their internet connection. The output files were then stored back in S3, ready for distribution.
    
3.  **Content Delivery**: Using [Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/media/creating-a-secure-video-on-demand-vod-platform-using-aws/), we configured our S3 buckets for rapid content delivery worldwide. This helped us deliver movies quickly to users across regions while reducing latency and ensuring high-quality streaming.
    
4.  **Front-End and Platform Compatibility**: We developed a [video player compatible with Roku devices](https://developer.roku.com/develop), enabling seamless playback across different screen sizes. The platform also integrated a backend system for purchasing and renting movies. Using AWS DynamoDB, we managed transactional data, including user purchases and rental status, to generate the appropriate streaming URLs for each user.

### Challenges and Cost Optimization

Despite successful implementation, we faced high operational costs, particularly for CDN usage and S3 storage. Scaling this infrastructure required exploring cost-effective solutions and optimizing the architecture.

To address these issues, we’re actively researching alternative strategies and tools to streamline our costs and enhance performance. If anyone has experience with newer tools, cost-saving tactics, or architecture optimization techniques for OTT platforms, we’d love to hear your insights.
